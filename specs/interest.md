#### Concepts
* **Annual interest rate**: The yearly percentage rate charged on the loan principal (fixed rate for initial period, floating rate thereafter)
* **Daily interest rate**: The interest rate applied per day, calculated as (annual interest rate / 100) / 365
```
dailyInterestRate = (annualInterestRate / 100) / 365
```
* **Daily Interest**: The cost of borrowing money, calculated based on the remaining principal and applicable interest rate
```
dailyInterest = remainingPrincipal * dailyInterestRate
```
* **Accrued unpaid interest**: Interest that has accumulated but is not yet due for payment (has not reached the next scheduled payment date)
* **When does interest become due?**: Interest accrued between two scheduled payment dates becomes due on the later payment date
* **Payable interest**: Cumulative total of all interest that has become due but has not yet been paid
